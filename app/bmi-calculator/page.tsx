                  The standard BMI formula is the same for both men and women.
                  However, body composition and fat distribution can differ
                  between genders. Athletes and muscular individuals may have a
                  higher BMI due to muscle mass, which doesn't necessarily
                  indicate poor health.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  BMI standards can vary slightly with age. For children and
                  teenagers, BMI is age and sex-specific, using percentile
                  charts. For adults, the standard BMI categories remain
                  consistent, but metabolism and body composition naturally
                  change with aging.

                <p className="text-gray-600">
                  BMI may not be the most accurate measure for athletes or
                  people with high muscle mass. Muscle is denser than fat, so
                  muscular individuals might have a high BMI despite being very
                  fit. Alternative methods like body fat percentage provide more
                  precise measurements.

                  Different ethnic groups may have different body compositions

                  It's recommended to check your BMI every 3-6 months. However,

                  Consistent diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes are more
